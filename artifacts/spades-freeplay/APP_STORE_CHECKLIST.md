## 6. App privacy ("nutrition label") answers

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Collects data? | Display name (entered per table) + connection metadata only |
| Linked to identity? | No accounts; display names are ephemeral and not tied to an identity |
| Tracking (IDFA)? | No |
| Third-party analytics/ads SDKs? | None |

> Fill the App Store Connect privacy questionnaire to match the above. Keep it
> minimal — the app has no login, no ads, and no third-party trackers.

## 7. TestFlight tester checklist

Have each tester confirm:

- ⬜ App installs and launches to onboarding on first run
- ⬜ Onboarding Skip / Back / Next / Start all work; doesn't reappear after finishing
- ⬜ "Take the tour" replays onboarding from home
- ⬜ **Quick Match**: create a table, share code, second device joins, both ready up, game starts
- ⬜ **Play a Friend**: create + join by 5-letter code both work
- ⬜ Full game plays end-to-end: coin toss → bidding → playing → round over → game over
- ⬜ New Match / Leave from the game-over screen work
- ⬜ Reconnect: background/relaunch returns the player to their seat
- ⬜ "How Dealing Works": animation plays, Skip / Fast Deal / Replay all work
- ⬜ How to Play and Fair Play screens render correctly
- ⬜ External links open in the browser: Website, Tournaments, Discord, Privacy, Terms, Support
- ⬜ Black/gold theme is consistent across every screen
- ⬜ Layout is safe on notch + home-indicator devices (no clipped content)
- ⬜ No cash / deposit / wallet / prize / gambling wording anywhere
