- `artifacts/spades-game/src/lib/game.ts` — shared game types for frontend

## Architecture decisions

- Game state is purely in-memory on the server (Map<roomCode, GameState>). No database needed for an ephemeral real-time game.
- Socket.io runs on the same HTTP server as Express. The proxy routes `/socket.io` to the API server alongside `/api`.
- Each player only receives their own hand; opponent hand size (count) is sent but not the cards.
- Spectators are stored in `GameState.spectators[]`. They receive a sanitized view with empty `hand` and `handSizes: [n0, n1]` for both seats. Spectator events: `join_as_spectator`, `reconnect_spectator`. All `place_bid`/`play_card` checks are seat-based (`players.findIndex`), so spectators are naturally rejected.
- Every state push goes through `broadcastState(io, state)` which fans out to both players AND all spectators with their respective sanitized views.
- Spades game engine is deterministic and server-authoritative — all move validation happens server-side.
- The react-vite frontend artifact is served at `/` (root); the API+WS server is at `/api` and `/socket.io`.

## Product

Two players can play a full head-to-head Spades match in real time via their browsers. The game enforces all standard Spades rules: hidden hands, sequential bidding, suit-following, spades-broken rule, nil bids (1v1 Competitive house rule: ±125), tier-based bag penalties (pre-round score < 250 → every 5 bags = −50; pre-round score ≥ 250 → every 10 bags = −100; threshold is locked at round start), and set penalties. First player to reach the target (250 or 500) and lead wins. Tied at target triggers a 3-round tiebreaker block; persistent tie starts a new block.

Spectators can join any room with the room code and watch live. They see scores, bids, tricks, card counts, played cards, round summaries, and the game-over screen — but never see either player's hand. Spectators cannot bid, play, or advance the game. Multiple spectators per room are allowed. Refresh restores spectators as spectators and players as players.

## Custom Tournament mode

Single-elimination bracket of 4, 8, 16, or 32 players, random seeding, every match is a standard 1v1 game.

- Server: `artifacts/api-server/src/game/tournament.ts` — Tournament store, bracket build/advance, `recordMatchResult`, `setPendingAssignment`.
- Socket events: `create_tournament`, `join_tournament`, `leave_tournament`, `subscribe_tournament`, `start_tournament` + server pushes `tournament_state`, `match_assigned`, `tournament_eliminated`, `tournament_complete`.
- Tournament-scope Socket.io room: `tournament:${code}` (separate from per-game rooms).
- Each game room created for a bracket match carries `GameState.tournamentRef = { code, matchId }`. The `playCard` → `game_over` hook calls `advanceTournamentOnGameOver(io, state)`, mirroring the KotT hook.
- Round 1 rooms are spun up immediately at start; Round 2+ rooms are created lazily in `recordMatchResult` once both feeder matches resolve.
- Match labels for tournament rooms: `"${name} · R${round} M${pos+1}"` or `"${name} · Finals"`.
- Frontend page: `artifacts/spades-game/src/pages/Tournament.tsx` — lobby, bracket, my-match CTA, champion screen. Lobby's `custom` mode swaps the Create/Join buttons to Create Tournament / Join Tournament.

### Tournament identity & reconnect (token-based)

- Every tournament participant (host + joiners) is issued a per-player secret token at join time (crypto.randomUUID). The token is returned in the create/join callback and the client stores it in localStorage under `spades_tournament_token_${CODE}`. The token is NEVER included in `sanitizeTournament` (no leak to other clients).
- `subscribe_tournament` only rebinds a player's socketId when BOTH the claimed name AND a matching token are presented. Without that, anyone who knew a participant's display name could hijack their seat (and their future `match_assigned`).
- `start_tournament` accepts EITHER the host's current socketId OR the host token — so a host can refresh in the lobby and still start.
- `reattachPlayerSocket` also refreshes `t.hostSocketId` when the reconnecting player is the host.
- `createMatchRoomAndAssign` writes a `pendingAssignment` onto each player record. On an authenticated `subscribe_tournament`, if a pending assignment exists, the server re-emits `match_assigned` (and re-joins the game room) — so a refresh on the tournament page during a live match lands the player back into their seat. `recordMatchResult` clears `pendingAssignment` for both players of the resolved match.
- Fresh-join path rejects duplicate names (case-insensitive, trimmed). Reconnecting from the same browser works because the cached token is passed through `joinTournament`.

## Host admin tools (Phase 6)

Token-gated dashboard the tournament host uses to recover from disconnects, AFK, and room glitches without abandoning the bracket.

- Page: `artifacts/spades-game/src/pages/HostDashboard.tsx` at `/tournament/:code/host`. Only reachable if `spades_tournament_token_${CODE}` exists in localStorage — otherwise bounces back to `/tournament/:code`. Tournament page shows a "Host tools" button to the host only.
- Server helpers in `tournament.ts`: `requireTournamentHost(t, token)` (token-only, no socketId fallback), `appendAdminAudit` / `getAdminAuditLog` (bounded 500-entry ring buffer, in-memory), `findMatchById`, `detachMatchRoom`.
- Socket events (all in `socket.ts`, all gated by `requireTournamentHost`, all write an `AdminAuditEntry` and emit `admin_audit_appended` to the tournament room):
  - `admin_dashboard` — returns per-match snapshot incl. live phase/scores/turn/paused/last-activity + per-seat connected flag.
  - `admin_audit_log` — returns audit tail, most-recent-first.
  - `admin_pause_match` / `admin_resume_match` — sets `GameState.isPaused`; `place_bid` / `play_card` reject while paused; `armTurnTimer` no-ops while paused.
  - `admin_reset_timer` — re-arms the current actor's turn timer.
  - `admin_remake_room` — detaches old room (cleanupRoom + deleteRoomState best-effort), spins up a fresh one via `createMatchRoomAndAssign`. Players get a new `match_assigned`.
  - `admin_mark_winner` — bracket-level advance. If a live room exists, routes through `forfeitTournamentMatch` (loser = opposite seat). If no room exists, calls `recordMatchResult` directly. Idempotent on replay of same winner; rejects conflict on different winner.
  - `admin_force_forfeit` (canonical) / `tournament_force_forfeit` (legacy alias kept for back-compat) — both delegate to the same `runAdminForceForfeit` helper, both write audit.
- `GameState.isPaused?: boolean` flag is broadcast in both player and spectator sanitized views.
- Bracket-repair safety: `recordMatchResult` is already idempotent (returns `"replay"` for same winner, `"rejected"` for conflict) — `admin_mark_winner` reuses that, so a host can safely retry on flaky connections without double-advancing.
- Audit log content (in-memory): action, actor name, matchId, roomCode, free-form payload (winner seat, forfeit seat, old room code, etc.). Bracket advancements ALSO write to the DB-backed `game_audit_log` via `recordMatchResultTx`.

## Pre-start player replacement (Phase 7)

- Host-only swap of a registered player for a backup, allowed only while `t.status === "lobby"`.
- Server: `replacePlayer(code, oldName, newName)` in `tournament.ts` validates lobby status, rejects host slot, rejects duplicate names, replaces in place (preserves roster index), issues a fresh per-player token, returns `{ newPlayerToken, removedName, replacementName }`.
- Socket event `host_replace_player` (in `socket.ts`) is gated by `requireTournamentHost(t, data.token)`, throws `"Cannot replace players after the tournament has started"` if status changed, writes an `AdminAuditEntry { action: "replace_player", payload: { removedName, replacementName } }`, broadcasts `tournament_state` + `admin_audit_appended`.
- Token isolation: the new player token goes back to the host via callback only; it never enters `sanitizeTournament` (matches the existing per-player token model).
- Backup-join path: host's success dialog produces `…/tournament/<CODE>?join_name=<NAME>&join_token=<TOKEN>`. Tournament.tsx parses this query on mount, writes name + token to localStorage via existing keys (`spades_player_name`, `spades_tournament_token_${CODE}`), strips the query, and the normal `subscribe_tournament` flow then authenticates as a reconnect.
- UI: lobby roster shows a small "Replace" button on each non-host filled slot (host-only). After confirm, a copy-link dialog appears with the backup's join URL.
- Audit action union extended in BOTH `artifacts/api-server/src/game/tournament.ts` AND `artifacts/spades-game/src/lib/game.ts` (`"replace_player"`).

## Tournament invite link

- Tournament lobby (`/tournament/<CODE>`) shows an "Invite link" panel to every roster member with a copy-to-clipboard button. The link is `${origin}${BASE_URL}/tournament/<CODE>` — points to the **tournament lobby**, NOT a 1v1 `/room/<CODE>` route.
- Visiting the link as a non-roster user shows the existing name+Join form (gated by `!iAmInRoster`). Visiting when the lobby is full shows a "Lobby full" amber banner instead — no join form, server would reject anyway with "Tournament is full".
- Copy button disables when `t.players.length >= t.size`. Capacity text on the panel updates live: `"3 slots open · 5/8"` → `"Lobby full (8/8)"`.
- Capacity rule is purely `t.size` (4/8/16/32 from `TournamentSize`); the 1v1 `maxPlayers=2` rule belongs to `engine.ts` rooms and is not used here.
- Duplicate-name guard lives in `joinTournament` (case-insensitive, trimmed) and surfaces to the user as toast `"Name already taken in this tournament"`.

## Match labels (auto-set for tournament matches)

- Server auto-sets `GameState.matchLabel` for tournament rooms to `"${tournamentName} · ${roundLabel}"`. Round labels: `Finals`, `Semifinal N`, `Quarterfinal N`, `Round of 16 · M{n}`, `Round of 32 · M{n}` (`roundLabelForMatch` in socket.ts; mirrored in Tournament.tsx bracket headers).
- Quick Match and King of the Table rooms have NO matchLabel — the manual label widget was removed from the Lobby once real Tournament mode shipped.
- Label is sent in both player and spectator sanitized views; shown in waiting screens, in-game status banner header, spectator footer, and game-over overlay.
- Game-over overlay has **Copy result** (plain text) and **Copy for Discord** (code-block) buttons. The Discord block contains: match label, winner/loser + final scores, rounds played, target, room code.

## KotT join-when-full fallback

When a third+ player clicks Join Match on a King-of-the-Table room (mode=`king`) and both seats are filled, the Lobby catches "Room is full" and automatically retries as `join_as_spectator` + `join_queue`. The user lands in `/room/<code>` as a spectator + queued challenger and auto-rotates into the loser's seat when the next match ends (per the existing `scheduleKingNextMatch` flow). Quick Match rooms (mode=`quick`) still hard-cap at 2 seats and reject the third joiner.

## Bidding order (coin toss + alternation)

- Coin toss happens ONCE per match (server-side `performCoinToss`, fired by `start_game`).
- The coin toss WINNER bids SECOND in Round 1. The LOSER bids FIRST.
- After Round 1, bidding order alternates every round — implemented by `getFirstBidderForRound(state, roundNumber)` (odd round → `firstBidderRound1`; even → opposite seat). `startRound` uses this for `currentBidder`.
- `GameState` carries `coinFlipWinner` and `firstBidderRound1` (both `0 | 1 | null`); both are sent to player and spectator sanitized views.
- `phase: "coin_toss"` is broadcast for ~3.5s before Round 1 deal so all 3 roles see the result with an overlay (`coin-toss-overlay` testid).
- `resetMatch` (New Match button) clears coin state so the next match re-flips.

## Turn timer (currently OFF by default)

- As of the post–June 1 prep window, **no room type arms a turn timer**. Quick Match and KotT were already untimed; tournament match rooms also now set `turnTimeoutMs = null` (single line in `socket.ts` `createMatchRoomAndAssign`, with the `TOURNAMENT_TURN_TIMEOUT_MS = 30_000` constant retained above so re-enabling is a one-line swap).
- `armTurnTimer` early-returns when `turnTimeoutMs` is null/0 (existing guard). No auto-bid / auto-play fires.
- Host pause/resume/reset admin tools remain functional — they're no-ops on rooms without a timer armed, which is the expected behavior.
- Deferred (post-June-1) — per-room "Turn Timer" dropdown (Off / 30 / 60 / 90), tournament-create selector defaulting to 60, 10-second-remaining client warning, expanded auto-action policy. Plan in conversation history; do NOT ship before the June 1 event.

## Disconnect grace, auto-forfeit & reconnect self-heal

- When a seated tournament-match player disconnects, `scheduleAutoForfeit` (socket.ts) arms a **5-minute** grace timer (`TOURNAMENT_AUTO_FORFEIT_MS = 300_000`) and immediately emits `tournament_player_disconnected` to the `tournament:${code}` room. The Tournament page shows a host-only toast (`tournamentNotice` in useSocket); other roles ignore it.
- If the player reconnects within the window, the timer is cancelled (`cancelAutoForfeit`). If it fires: when the match `isPaused`, the forfeit is **deferred** (re-arms with `notify=false`) so the host can pause to hold a disconnected player's slot indefinitely; otherwise the match auto-forfeits so the bracket keeps moving.
- **Reconnect self-heal (client):** a player's cached room code can go stale after a round ends (old room cleaned up → server throws "Room not found"). On that error, Room.tsx routes to `/tournament/<code>` (looked up via `spades_room_tournament_<roomCode>`) instead of dumping to `/`. The tournament page re-subscribes and the server re-emits `match_assigned` from the still-live `pendingAssignment`, landing the player back in their CURRENT match. The player reconnect token is preserved on stale-room/retryable errors and only cleared on a genuine seat/token rejection.
- The reconnecting screen also shows a **Host tools** shortcut when this browser holds `spades_tournament_token_<code>`, so a dropped host never loses access to pause/forfeit/remake.

## Gotchas

- Always restart the API Server workflow after backend changes; the frontend is hot-reloaded by Vite.
- The `/socket.io` path must remain in `artifacts/api-server/.replit-artifact/artifact.toml` `paths` array or the WebSocket proxy will silently drop connections.
- Room state is lost on server restart (in-memory only).
